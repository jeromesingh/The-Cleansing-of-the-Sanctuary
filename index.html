  hear:

  <p class="bible" >Revelation 21:11-12 KJV  Having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper

<p class="bible">Genesis 3:23-24 KJV  Therefore the LORD God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till the ground from whence he
was taken.  (24)  So he drove out the man; and he placed at the east of the garden of Eden Cherubims, and a flaming
sword which turned every way, to keep the way of the tree of life.

</p>

<p class="bible">Hebrews 2:9-15 KJV  But we see Jesus, who was made a little lower than the angels for the suffering of death, crowned
with glory and honour; that he by the grace of God should taste death for every man.  (10)  For it became him, for whom
are all things, and by whom are all things, in bringing many sons unto glory, to make the captain of their salvation
perfect through sufferings.  (11)  For both he that sanctifieth and they who are sanctified are all of one: for which
cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren,  (12)  Saying, I will declare thy name unto my brethren, in the midst of
the church will I sing praise unto thee.  (13)  And again, I will put my trust in him. And again, Behold I and the
children which God hath given me.  (14)  Forasmuch then as the children are partakers of flesh and blood, he also
himself likewise took part of the same; that through death he might destroy him that had the power of death, that is,
the devil;  (15)  And deliver them who through fear of death were all their lifetime subject to bondage.

<p class="bible" >1 Thessalonians 4:15-16 KJV  For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord, that we which are alive and remain unto

them, Concerning the feasts of the LORD, which ye shall proclaim to be holy convocations, even these are my feasts.
 (3)  Six days shall work be done: but the seventh day is the sabbath of rest, an holy convocation; ye shall do no work
therein: it is the sabbath of the LORD in all your dwellings.  (4)  These are the feasts of the LORD, even holy
convocations, which ye shall proclaim in their seasons.  (5)  In the fourteenth day of the first month at even is the
LORD'S passover.  (6)  And on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread unto the LORD: seven
days ye must eat unleavened bread.  (7)  In the first day ye shall have an holy convocation: ye shall do no servile work
therein.  (8)  But ye shall offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD seven days: in the seventh day is an holy
convocation: ye shall do no servile work therein.  (9)  And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,  (10)  Speak unto the
children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye be come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest
thereof, then ye shall bring a sheaf of the firstfruits of your harvest unto the priest:  (11)  And he shall wave the
sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you: on the morrow after the sabbath the priest shall wave it.

</p>

<p class="text">The 14<sup>th</sup> day is the passover, the 15<sup>th</sup> day is day is the feast of unleavened bread which should also be honoured as sabbath,

leaven of malice and wickedness; but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth.

</p>

<p class="bible">John 6:3-5 KJV  And Jesus went up into a mountain, and there he sat with his disciples.  (4)  And the passover, a feast

<h5>Pentecost</h5>

<p class="bible">Leviticus 23:15-21 KJV  And ye shall count unto you from the morrow after the sabbath, from the day that ye brought the

shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meat offering unto the LORD.  (17)  Ye shall bring out of your
habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; they are
the firstfruits unto the LORD.  (18)  And ye shall offer with the bread seven lambs without blemish of the first year,
and one young bullock, and two rams: they shall be for a burnt offering unto the LORD, with their meat offering, and
their drink offerings, even an offering made by fire, of sweet savour unto the LORD.  (19)  Then ye shall sacrifice one
kid of the goats for a sin offering, and two lambs of the first year for a sacrifice of peace offerings.  (20)  And the
priest shall wave them with the bread of the firstfruits for a wave offering before the LORD, with the two lambs: they
shall be holy to the LORD for the priest.  (21)  And ye shall proclaim on the selfsame day, that it may be an holy
convocation unto you: ye shall do no servile work therein: it shall be a statute for ever in all your dwellings
throughout your generations.

<p class="bible">Acts 1:1-8 KJV  The former treatise have I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach,  (2)  Until
the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Ghost had given commandments unto the apostles whom he
had chosen:  (3)  To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them
forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:  (4)  And, being assembled together with them,
commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, ye
have heard of me.  (5)  For John truly baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Ghost not many days
hence.  (6)  When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore
again the kingdom to Israel?  (7)  And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the
Father hath put in his own power.  (8)  But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you: and ye
shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the
earth.
